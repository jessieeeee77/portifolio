The ten portifolios concentrated on building up graphs and data analyses for my first year and thesis project. I used SEM, ggplot, multigroup modeling, t-test, and ANOVA tests, chisq test. Basically I try to redo the data analyses that I used in SPSS for my first year project, and then do some data analyses for my thesis. R did a great job at visualizing the associations and interactions that I aimed to investigate in my thesis.
The following codes represent the major task or accomplished goals of each of my portifolio.
